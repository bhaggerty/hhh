##Help build the future of infrastructure at CoreOS.


CoreOS is looking for an infrastructure and operations engineer to build, operate, and run critical backend web infrastructure using containers, distributed schedulers, dynamic service discovery, and automated systems. You will be supported by a team eager to develop solid infrastructure based on best practices and solid technology.


As part of the infrastructure team you will also help influence the products we build. At CoreOS we develop cutting edge infrastructure products centered around distributed systems to build "Google-like Infrastructure for Everyone Else" (GIFEE). On this journey we have introduced popular and widely deployed products and open source projects like CoreOS Linux, etcd, Quay.io, Tectonic, rkt and many more. We are one of the first companies to run production services on the open source clustering system introduced by Google and based on its own internal "Borg system", called Kubernetes.

**Primary responsibilities will include:**


* Deploying clusters of machines based on Kubernetes on cloud-providers
* Understanding how clusters behave, troubleshooting problems/failures
* Building fault-tolerance, failover, recovery procedures for applications
* Monitoring and alerting of cluster and application health
* Automating application deployment to the cluster

**Weâ€™re looking for someone who will embrace such role in a particularly fast-paced environment. Relevant skills/experience may include:**

* Collaborate with application and operations engineers
* Deploy and manage backend web applications
* Debug and operate a cluster of Linux systems
* Operate and build Linux application containers e.g. rkt, docker
* Configure and monitor distributed systems e.g. monitoring, logging
* Cloud provider experience e.g. AWS, GCE, etc.
* Write Go, YAML, JSON, and bash
